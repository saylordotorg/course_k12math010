**Unit 4: Connecting Algebra and Geometry through Coordinates** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will further examine the properties you have learned
thus far but with the help of algebra and the coordinate plane. You will
use the Pythagorean theorem to help you find distances and your
knowledge of equations of lines to verify geometric relationships,
including properties of triangles and quadrilaterals, slopes of parallel
and perpendicular lines, and special lines within triangles. Are you
feeling a bit unsure of your algebra skills? No fear, as there will be
brief reviews of the skills needed in order to apply algebra to the
investigation of geometric properties![**[4]**](#_ftn1)*

**4.1 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines in the Coordinate Plane** <span
id="4.1"></span> 
This subunit is the first that examines geometric properties using
algebra and coordinate geometry. Here you will review how to calculate
slope and write the equation of a line. With this information, you will
be well armed to investigate the slopes of parallel and perpendicular
lines, which will allow you to classify quadrilaterals on the coordinate
plane in later subunits. Here you will be able to revisit proofs and
apply logic skills learned in prior units to your understanding of the
properties and relationships of quadrilaterals. The resources in this
section provide explanatory content and practice problems.

**4.2 Area and Perimeter** <span id="4.2"></span> 
This subunit continues with the task of analyzing geometric properties
using algebra and coordinate geometry. Here you will review how to
calculate the distance of a segment, find the midpoint of a segment, and
solve systems of equations. With this information, you will be able to
identify the key dimensions of figures on the coordinate plane,
calculate their distances, and find the area and perimeter of these
figures. These skills are helping you build up to finding the areas and
perimeters of irregular (curved) figures, as seen in calculus and used
by engineers when developing many products, including cars. The
resources in this subunit provide explanatory content, practice
problems, and investigatory work.

    instructions of the activity, and answer the questions below the
    applet. Now draw a triangle on a coordinate plane and use coordinate
    geometry to draw the three altitudes of the triangle and find the
    orthocenter. Do this two or three times or until you feel
    comfortable with this skill. Remember, you will need to find the
    equation of the line for two of the altitudes and find their point
    of intersection by solving a system of equations.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and watch the short
    demonstration of the points of concurrency—centroid, circumcenter,
    and orthocenter align to create the Euler line. After investigating
    the Euler Line, draw a triangle on the coordinate plane. Then, using
    coordinate geometry, find the centroid, circumcenter, and
    orthocenter, and draw a line through these three points, creating a
    Euler line.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, scroll down to the
    section titled “Reflection,” and download the document titled
    “Concurring with Points of Concurrency.” Here you will answer a
    series of questions that require you to apply your knowledge of
    points of concurrency to real-world situations. When you are
    finished, use the answer key provided on the last page of the
    document to review your work.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour.
