title: "K12MATH010: Geometry"
course_description: "This course looks at geometric figures that we see in everyday life to understand the patterns in their attributes and how their measures relate to these patterns. It expands on the basic geometric concepts learned in previous math courses by applying these concepts in new contexts."

**Unit 1: Congruence, Proof, and Constructions** <span id="1"></span> 
*Geometry is all about recognizing relationships and patterns within a
single figure and among two or more figures. This begins with the
concept of rigid transformations (translations, reflections, and
rotations) to explain congruence. Congruence is one of the prominent
concepts that will allow you to explain figures and their relationships.
With a strong understanding of congruence, you will investigate
congruency shortcuts and will be introduced to formal proofs using this
foundational knowledge. You will then continue to develop your comfort
with proofs, in a variety of formats, by using them to prove geometric
theorems, or relationships, introduced in previous years and solving
problems involving lines, angles, triangles, and quadrilaterals.
Finally, formal constructions with compass and straightedge are
introduced, and you will use your knowledge of geometric properties of
figures to complete a variety of constructions and explain why they
work.[**[1]**](#_ftn1)*

**1.1 Review: Rigid Transformations and Congruence** <span
id="1.1"></span> 
This section reviews the rigid transformations (translations, rotations,
and reflections) studied in previous mathematics courses to further
examine congruence. The structure of things in both nature and the
man-made world depends on congruence: beehives, architecture, railroads,
and more! The concept of congruence is critical in analyzing attributes
of one figure and between figures. The resources in this section provide
explanatory content as well as opportunities to investigate the
transformations and how they relate to congruence and opportunities to
apply this knowledge in problem-solving situations.

**1.5 Reasoning and Proof: Parallelograms** <span id="1.5"></span> 
This is the last of several sections that uses proofs to revisit
geometric properties of geometric figures introduced in previous
mathematics courses. Specifically, this section examines properties of
parallelograms. The resources in this section provide explanatory
content with embedded examples and solutions.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the sections
    entitled “What is a Parallelogram?” and “Proof of Opposite Sides
    Theorem.” Take notes and consider this question: What is true about
    the opposite sides of parallelograms?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. In the previous
    section, you read about the definition of a parallelogram and the
    proof of the opposite sides theorem. The reading explains that the
    opposite angles theorem is almost identical. What does the opposite
    angles theorem say? Review the opposite sides theorem and then
    create a two-column proof for the opposite angles theorem.  
        
     Reviewing this section and writing the proof should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
