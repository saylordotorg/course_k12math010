Geometry comes from the Greek roots *geo*-, meaning Earth, and
–*metron*, meaning measure. Thus, geometry literally means the process
of measuring the Earth. In a more mathematical sense, this course looks
at geometric figures that we see in everyday life to understand the
patterns in their attributes and how their measures relate to these
patterns. It expands on the basic geometric concepts learned in previous
math courses, through the applications of these concepts in new
contexts. You will learn to develop formal proofs that support patterns
and rules of geometric figures previously investigated, including
congruent and similar figures, triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles.
From here, the course expands on your knowledge about triangles and the
Pythagorean theorem, introducing trigonometry of both right triangles
and general triangles. The course will help you develop links between
the attributes of two-dimensional and three-dimensional figures; help
you develop formulas for calculating the volume of prisms, cylinders,
pyramids, cones, and spheres; and assist you in using geometric modeling
to solve problems involving three-dimensional figures. Toward the end of
the course, you will use your algebra skills and the coordinate plane to
further investigate and prove the attributes of geometric figures and
their relationships with each other. The last unit continues to develop
your knowledge of probability, using geometric probability models where
appropriate. While this is a geometry course, it assumes prior knowledge
of foundational geometry concepts from previous math courses and mastery
of algebra. Therefore, to successfully progress through this course, you
should arrive with a strong foundation in algebra and familiarity with
some basic geometric concepts. You should enter into this course having
studied a variety of geometric figures and their distinguishing
attributes. You should be able to draw and describe geometrical figures
and the relationships between figures. Additionally, you should be
comfortable with the concepts of area, perimeter, surface area, and
volume, and you should be able to apply these concepts to problem
solving. Furthermore, you should be comfortable graphing points on the
coordinate plane. Finally, you should have a working definition of
congruence and similarity, as this is the starting point for this course
and it takes off from there. In addition to learning geometry, this
course will work on developing mathematical practice skills that will
help you to be successful in future courses. Therefore, in addition to
developing geometric reasoning and an understanding of the physical
patterns that exist in the world around us, this course will enable you
to continue developing your skills of mathematical practice, including
problem solving, critical thinking, mathematical modeling, and the
ability to use a variety of tools to effectively tackle problems.
Completion of this course will provide you with the foundation necessary
to successfully progress to Algebra 2. Additionally, this content should
prove helpful in developing a solid foundation for science courses,
specifically physics, where knowledge of geometric figures and their
attributes is critical.

### Course Information

Welcome to Geometry. General information on this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Ms. Kate
Cottrell](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#MsKateCottrell)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   CK-12 Textbook: [*Geometry* (2nd
    ed.)](http://www.ck12.org/book/Geometry---Second-Edition/)
-   CK-12 Textbook: *[Basic Probability and Statistics Concepts—A Full
    Course](http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Basic-Probability-and-Statistics-Concepts---A-Full-Course/r11/)*
-   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete the final exam.  
    
 Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take a total of approximately
**66 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and
then set goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should take
approximately 12 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours, 30
minutes) on Monday and Tuesday nights, subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours)
on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and so forth.
