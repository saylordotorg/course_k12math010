title: "K12MATH010: Geometry"
course_description: "This course looks at geometric figures that we see in everyday life to understand the patterns in their attributes and how their measures relate to these patterns. It expands on the basic geometric concepts learned in previous math courses by applying these concepts in new contexts."

**Unit 5: Circles** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will deepen your understanding of circles. You will
investigate a variety of theorems, with an emphasis on perpendicularity
and inscribed angles, helping you to see symmetry in circles and see
applications of triangle congruence criteria. You will study additional
properties among chords, secants, and tangents as an application of
similarity. You will examine circumference and area and further your
understanding of these concepts by also learning to calculate arc
lengths and areas of sectors of circles. Finally, you will investigate
learned theorems and properties of circles using the coordinate plane as
an additional resource. Here you will also study the equation of a
circle, learning how to identify the equation based on the graphed
circle, graph the circle given the equation, and find the intersections
between lines and circles or parabolas and between two circles, by
solving quadratic equations.[**[5]**](#_ftn1)*

**5.1 Properties** <span id="5.1"></span> 
In this subunit, you will examine properties and theorems of circles.
Here you will continue practicing the logic skills you learned
previously, writing proofs related to the circle theorems you study.
This section will build on your knowledge of angles and segments and
review the basic parts of a circle: chord, tangent, radius, and
diameter. The resources in this subunit provide explanatory content as
well as practice problems that allow you to receive immediate feedback
on your progress and understanding.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. Read, take notes, and
    complete the examples as you go. Answers follow each example. Upon
    reading this section, you should be able to graph a circle, write
    the equation of a circle given the key information, and find the
    radius and center given the equation of the circle.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and then click on the
    point on the radius of the circle. Move it using your mouse and
    notice how the equation of the circle changes with the radius. Read
    the content below the coordinate plane, which reviews what you read
    from the CK-12 textbook, *Geometry*. When you reach “Things to Try,”
    repeat the activity until you can complete it successfully three
    times.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and then click on the
    center of the circle. Move the center of the circle using your
    mouse, and notice how the equation of the circle changes as the
    circle’s center changes. Read the content below the coordinate
    plane, which reviews what you read from the CK-12 textbook,
    *Geometry*. When you reach “Things To Try,” repeat the activity
