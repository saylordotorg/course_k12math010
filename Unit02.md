**Unit 2: Similarity, Proof, and Trigonometry** <span id="2"></span> 
*Pilots trying to avoid collisions with mountains, engineers trying to
build safe suspension bridges, surveyors trying to assist with city
planning, and architects trying to design music halls with rich
acoustics all rely on their understanding of similarity and trigonometry
to be successful. This unit will also build on your knowledge of
transformations, but this time you will look at a nonrigid
transformation, the dilation and, in conjunction with proportional
reasoning, you will develop a formal understanding of similarity. You
will investigate shortcuts for determining similarity between triangles
and solve problems involving similar figures with a heavy emphasis on
triangles. Next, you will be introduced to triangle trigonometry, and
you will learn about special right triangles and relate their properties
to the Pythagorean theorem, studied in previous courses. Finally, you
will learn to find the missing measures of general triangles, that is to
say triangles that are not necessarily right triangles, using the laws
of sines and cosines.[**[2]**](#_ftn1)*[](#_ftn1)

**2.1 Review: Dilations and Similarity** <span id="2.1"></span> 
This section reviews the nonrigid transformation, the dilation, studied
in previous mathematics courses, as well as proportional reasoning to
examine the concept of similarity. We see similarity regularly in our
everyday lives. For example, photos generally do not show an image that
is true to size. Sometimes they show a much smaller version of the image
and sometimes, especially in nature and science, photos show a much
larger image of the actual object. The resources in this section provide
explanatory content as well as opportunities to investigate the
transformations and how they relate to similarity and opportunities to
apply this knowledge in problem-solving situations.

    Link: CK-12: *Geometry*: [“Special Right
    Triangles”](http://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Geometry-Second-Edition/section/8.4/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the content
    in the sections titled “Isosceles Right Triangles” and “30-60-90
    Triangles.” Complete the example problems as you go. The solutions
    are explained following each problem. Upon completion of the
    reading, you should be able to identify the two special right
    triangles introduced in the reading, identify the relationship that
    exists among the sides of each triangle, and use these ratios to
    find the length of an unknown side.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 20
    minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. This page will give
    you an opportunity to apply your knowledge in a new and challenging
    context. The concepts of the laws of sine and cosine are reviewed
    for you, and the concept of bearing and how it relates to these
    mathematical concepts are explained. Read carefully and take notes.
    At the bottom of the page below the subtitle, “Applying what we know
    to solve bearing and orienteering problems with Law of Sines and Law
    of Cosines,” are two application problems. Attempt to solve them on
    your own first. If you are struggling with the first one, read
    through the explanation or play the video explanation provided at
    the bottom of the page. Using this explanation, attempt the second
    problem on your own and then compare your work to the explanation
    provided.
