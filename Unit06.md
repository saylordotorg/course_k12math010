**Unit 6: Applications of Probability** <span id="6"></span> 
*Ever played darts? Geometric probability helps us understand the
likelihood of hitting the bull’s-eye. Ever taken a train or a bus to
meet a friend? Geometric probability helps us understand your likelihood
of arriving on time. This course ends by revisiting probability,
building on concepts learned in previous grades but now using geometric
probability models where possible. You will use set theory to compute
and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities of compound
events, examining mutually exclusive events, independent events, and
conditional probability. You will then apply this knowledge to make
informed decisions and evaluation decisions made using
probability.[**[6]**](#_ftn1)*

**6.1 Independent and Dependent Events** <span id="6.1"></span> 
In this subunit, you will review the basic concepts of probability and
how they relate to your everyday life. You will examine the probability
of independent events taking place—earning an A in Spanish class and
earning a B in Biology, for example. You will also examine the
probability of dependent events—having a day off and going to an art
museum, for example. The concepts of mutually exclusive and mutually
inclusive events are related to this. When determining the probability
of several events, these terms are important to understand in order to
avoid double counting. The resources in this subunit provide explanatory
content as well as practice problems that allow you to receive immediate
feedback on your progress and understanding.

**6.2 Conditional Probability** <span id="6.2"></span> 
This subunit builds on the previous section. You will examine
permutations and combinations, looking at how order may affect the
probability (as with permutations) or may not affect the probability (as
with combinations). You can use permutations to examine the probability
of correctly guessing your locker combination or to decide how many
different groups of 4 your teacher can arrange from your class of 24
students. Additionally, you will examine conditional probability, which
exists when the probability of the second event depends on the outcome
of the first event. The resources in this subunit provide explanatory
content as well as practice problems that allow you to receive immediate
feedback on your progress and understanding.
