**Unit 3: Extending to Three Dimensions** <span id="3"></span> 
*You’ve made it to the third dimension! In the first two units, you
reviewed some of the important properties of two-dimensional figures and
proved many of them using formal proofs. Also, prior to this course, you
worked with the concepts of area, perimeter, surface area, and volume,
and used formulas to calculate them. This unit expands on these
concepts, furthering investigating properties of three-dimensional
figures, investigating cross-sections (two-dimensional figures created
when you “slice” through a three-dimensional figure), and applying this
knowledge in the development of volume formulas and the solution of
problems.[**[3]**](#_ftn1)*

**3.1 Exploring Solids** <span id="3.1"></span> 
In this subunit, we examine the properties of solid figures. You will
see the relationship that exists among faces, edges, and vertices.
Additionally, you will examine the cross-sections of solid figures, the
two-dimensional figures that are created when you slice a solid figure
from different angles. This unit is about visualizing solids and
understanding the variety of components. Skills learned here will assist
you when you take a calculus course, as calculus works with curved
figures. Being able to visualize these figures now and calculate the
volume and surface area of the basic solid figures will allow for a more
enjoyable learning experience when you reach more advanced math courses.
The resources in this section provide explanatory content, practice
problems, and some investigatory activities.

**3.3 Geometric Modeling with Three-Dimensional Figures** <span
id="3.3"></span> 
In this subunit, you will examine more complex relationships of solid
figures, including the ratios created by surface areas and volumes of
solid figures, the solid figures created by revolutions on the
coordinate plane, and additional connections between surface area and
volume. Applications of the relationship between surface area and volume
are most often seen in science in understanding a substance’s ability to
melt or evaporate or in studying animals and their ability to stay cool.
Revolutions around the axis are seen again in calculus but with more
complex figures that include curved lines. The resources in this section
provide explanatory content, practice problems, and some investigatory
activities.

    Spin”](http://sketchup-math.wikispaces.com/Polygon+Spin) (HTML)   
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above. You will find a page
    that invites you to create solid figures by rotating or revolving a
    polygon around the x- or y-axis. Sketch a triangle or rectangle and
    rotate it around an axis. Describe the figure you create. Is it a
    cylinder? Is it a cone? Does it have a hole? What is the shape of
    the whole? Calculate the volume and surface area of the figure that
    you create. Repeat this exercise three times. If you need additional
    assistance using the Google SketchUp tool, click
    [here](http://sketchup-math.wikispaces.com/Lesson+1) (HTML) for a
    tutorial.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above. You will find a page
    with four tabs. Click on the tab labeled “Learner.” Here you will
    need to download the worksheet entitled “Surface Area and Volume
    Exploration Questions.” Next, click on the tab labeled “Activity”
    and use the instructions from the worksheet to guide you.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Unit”](http://hendrymath9s2.wikispaces.com/Worksheets%28AV%29) (DOC)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above. You will find a page
    with a list of resources for practicing the calculations of surface
    area and volume of solid figures. Scroll down to the bottom of the
    page and select the last file entitled “4-8b Review of Surface Area
    and Volume.” Here you will find many problems for practice. Complete
    question 5. Obviously, if you’d like the additional practice, you
    are welcome to try the others as well; however, question 5 allows
    you to examine both surface area and volume in the same scenario.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Cups”**
    Link: Mathematics Assessment Project: [“Modeling: Rolling
    Cups”](http://map.mathshell.org/materials/lessons.php?taskid=428) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please begin by clicking on this
    [link](http://map.mathshell.org/lesson_support/rolling_cups/cups_task.htm) (Flash).
    Examine the four objects. The task is to determine which would roll
    in the largest circle. Watch the four short videos to see a
    demonstration of each. The videos are found on the tabs at the top
    of the page. You can then use the tab titled “Cup Rolling
    Calculator” to further investigate what happens. Once you have
    completed these steps, you are ready for the evaluation. Please
    click on the link provided above, and scroll down to the section of
    the lesson titled “Resources.” Download the PDF file underneath
    “Lesson (complete).” The assessment is on page S-1 and is titled
    “Modeling Rolling Cups.” Complete the questions to the best of your
    ability. Pages S-4 and S-5 provide hints to help you answer the
    questions. When you are finished, use the solutions on pages T-8 and
    T-9 to check your understanding.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.
